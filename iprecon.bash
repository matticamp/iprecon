# IP address checking script
# Created by Mattia Campagnano on Tue Jan 2 21:37:04 EST 2018

# This Bash script reads an IP address from the user and validates it.

# Then it performs nslookup, dig, whois and host commands on the supplied IP.

echo -n "Please enter an IP address to check:  ";

# Ask user to indicate four output files, one for each command to be run
